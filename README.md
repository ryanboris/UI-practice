# Title

Git && User Interface Practice Repo

## Git Flow Procedure

Before you begin to work on any of the bulk of the project please do the following:

1. Fork the project.
2. Add me as a collaborator under the repo settings.
3. Clone your forked copy to your local machine.
4. `cd` into the cloned directory and run `code .` to open VSC
5. run `git checkout -b YOUR-NAME`

   it should then tell you that you created a new branch and should have switched you over to it

6. edit the index.html in VSC and add the meta viewport tag and save the file
7. run `git add .`
8. run `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
9. run `git push -u origin YOUR-NAME`
10. Go to your repo (MAKE SURE IT HAS YOUR NAME/REPO NAME) on github and go to the pull request tab
11. Use the green button to create a pull request
12. Change the base fork to your master fork and you want to merge in the branch that has your name
13. Add me as a reviewer
14. Submit the pull request
15. Complete MVP
16. Stretch if MVP is done
